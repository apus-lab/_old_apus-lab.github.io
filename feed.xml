<p>In a nutshell, PyPose enables the <strong>full-stack, end-to-end differentiable learning</strong> for robotic applications.  One key challenge in robotic learning is the effective representation of poses, i.e., orientations and positions of robots, that requires the usage of Lie group; PyPose is a unique library that bakes Lie group into PyTorch in the robotic context.  In this effort, in collaboration with Dr. Geng, we contributed functionalities and applications on the control and system side.</p>

  <li>This paper aims to address one main challenge in the <strong>energy management of electrified aircraft</strong> involving nonlinear electro-thermo-mechanical dynamics.  Hierarchical control is a potent method to control the system in an efficient and nearly optimal manner, yet it requires the knowledge of <strong>multiple timescales</strong> that are unlikely available.</li>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Fluid dynamics exhibits complex, multi-scale spatial structure, chaotic dynamics in time, and bifurcation in the relevant parameters. Among these challenges, spatial complexity is the major barrier to modeling and control of fluid dynamics, which motivates the need for dimensionality reduction. Existing paradigms, such as proper orthogonal decomposition or convolutional autoencoders, both struggle to accurately and efficiently represent flow structures for problems requiring variable geometry, nonuniform grid resolution (e.g., wall-bounded flows, flow phenomenon induced by small geometry features), adaptive mesh refinement, or parameter-dependent meshes. To resolve these difficulties, we propose Neural Implicit Flow (NIF) as a general framework that enables a compact and flexible dimension reduction of large-scale, parametric, spatial-temporal data into mesh-agnostic fixed-length representations. This work complements existing meshless methods, e.g., physics-informed neural networks, and we focus specifically on obtaining reduced coordinates where modeling and control tasks may be performed more efficiently. We apply our mesh-agnostic approach to several fluid flows, including flow past a cylinder, sea surface temperature data, and 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In these examples, we demonstrate the utility of NIF for parametric surrogate modeling, efficient differential query in space, learning non-linear manifolds, and the interpretable low-rank decomposition of fluid flow data.</p>]]></content><author><name>Daning Huang</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="Seminar" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We hosted Dr. Shaowu Pan from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for a seminar in our department.

<p>Understanding the occurrence and propagation of <strong>regional heatwaves</strong> is of vital importance to mitigate the consequence of heat extremes. A low-cost, accurate, and timely prediction algorithm for regional heatwaves is desirable. In this study, we use the measurement data set collected from the ground weather stations, together with graph-based deep learning algorithm, to predict the occurrence of regional heatwaves in the lower 48 states of the U.S. The prediction model is trained by the daily weather observations from 91 weather stations and <strong>achieves over 90% accuracy</strong> in validation. In addition, we extract the spatiotemporal patterns of the climate dynamics learned by the deep learning model to facilitate the interpretation of the results. The proposed modeling framework can be applied to predict other types of extreme events, such as extreme precipitation, drought, and compounded events. The analysis of the model structure will also enhance our understanding of the causal inference between climate regions in the U.S. from a brand-new deep learning perspective.</p>

<p>The session will focus on the operator-theoretic reduced-order modeling (OTROM) methods based on the Koopman theory for the aeroelastic modeling of nonlinear structures and the application of these methods to different systems: from small unmanned aerial vehicles to rockets, across broad flight regimes (subsonic to hypersonic), where aeroelasticity has significant interactions with controllers, propulsion, materials, and thermal effects. The uniqueness of operator-theoretic methods is to transform a nonlinear controlled system to a linear one without introducing errors, which opens up a new venue for efficient and robust aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic modeling and analysis of modern aircraft. Potential topics of study include the model-based and data-driven methods for generating OTROM’s, the analysis of OTROM’s for system stability, controllability, and observability, as well as the application of OTROMs to the aforementioned scenarios. Investigation on the parametrization of OTROM for different flight conditions and aircraft configurations is of particular interest. This special session will serve as a forum for multidisciplinary researchers from structural dynamics, fluid dynamics, and dynamics and control to disseminate the latest innovations in these domains. The committee welcomes submissions from industry, government, academia, and small businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization is becoming indispensable for modern high-performance engineering systems. However, this class of problem usually comes with an extremely high computational cost, even for the analysis of just one configuration; let alone a systematic parametric study for optimization. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are typical approaches to reducing the computational cost to a tractable level. However, the existing ROMs suffer from the curse of dimensionality that roots from the need to parameterize and sample the system configuration parameters. This work presents our recently developed methodology of physics-infused ROM (PIROM), where a first-principle-based analytical component is augmented with a data-driven physically-interpretable component. Both components admit an algebraic-differential form for enhanced modeling capability for nonlinearity. A demonstration is presented for hypersonic aerothermal load prediction, a key ingredient for the aerothermoelastic analysis and optimization of hypersonic vehicles. The PIROM achieves an accuracy close to the high-fidelity solver with excellent sampling efficiency and extrapolation capability. These results open up a new approach for the analysis and optimization of multi-physical systems.</p>

<p>We have been developing a novel <strong>physics-infused reduced-order modeling (PIROM)</strong> approach for efficient and accurate modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems. The PIROM consists of</p>

<p>a physics-based dynamical component that</p>
<ul>
  <li>represents the known physical processes, and</li>
  <li>ensures validity of the model over a wide range of operating conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>and a data-driven dynamical component that</p>
<ul>
  <li>represents the unknown physical processes, and</li>
  <li>corrects the dynamics for higher predictive fidelity</li>
</ul>

<p>Both components are <strong>differential equations</strong>, and hence new algorithms based on <strong>optimal control theory</strong> are developed to train these models.</p>

<p><br clear="right" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/post_2301_2.png" align="right" width="700" /></p>

<p>One benchmark problem that we considered is the high-speed aerothermal modeling of a heat-conducting and deforming structure.  The PIROM demonstrated superior performance than the conventional surrogate models, in terms of <strong>accuracy, sampling efficiency, and generalizability</strong> over a wide range of operating conditions and structural boundary conditions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the PIROM-based aerothermal model is applied to the aerothermal load modeling for <strong>hypersonic aerothermoelastic (ATE)</strong> analysis and is found to accelerate the ATE simulations by two to three orders of magnitude while maintaining an accuracy comparable to high-fidelity solutions based on computational fluid dynamics.</p>

<p>Figure on the right illustrates the superior capability of PIROM in <strong>coupled</strong> ATE simulation in a scenario <strong>unseen</strong> to all models.</p>
<ul>
  <li>TVI - physics-based differential model: Simple but not accurate</li>
  <li>POD/Kriging - conventional surrogate: Brutal force and limited range of applicability</li>
  <li>PIROM - Accurate and generalizable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that coupled analysis is the most challenging scenario for testing a ROM, as <strong>modeling errors propagates and accumulates over time</strong>.</p>

<p><br clear="right" /></p>

<p>The PIROM-based ATE solver is further demonstrated by a parametric study on the effects of boundary conditions and rib supports on the ATE response of a compliant and heat-conducting panel structure. The results not only reveal the <strong>dramatic snap-through behavior</strong> with respect to spring constraints of boundary conditions but also demonstrate the potential of the PIROM to facilitate the rapid and accurate <strong>design and optimization of multidisciplinary systems such as hypersonic structures</strong>.</p>
