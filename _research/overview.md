# The Grand Challenge

<img src="/img/rsch_oct.png" align="right" width="400px"/>

Our research is motivated by the desire to expand the last frontier of aerospace engineering, represented by **hypersonic vehicles** and high-speed **VTOL aircraft**. The development of these advanced aerospace systems has been constrained by their inherent **complex multi-physics nature** and the **strong coupling among their subsystems**, including but not limited to

+ Aerodynamics/fluid dynamics, Thermodynamics, ...
+ Structural dynamics, Material response, ...
+ Flight dynamics and control, Guidance and navigation, ...
+ Propulsion system, ...
+ etc...

While there are relatively mature solutions for each single disciplinary/subsystem involved in multi-physics problems, these problems cannot be completely understood and solved without integrating the **M**ulti-**D**isciplinary tools for **A**nalyzing, **O**ptimizing, and **C**ontrolling (MDAOC) of future unconventional aircraft.  For example,

+ How does **fluid-thermal-structural interaction** (FTSI) impact the **autonomous flight** of hypersonic vehicles?  Conversely, for better autonomy how to design the vehicle for desired FTSI response?
+ How does the **unsteady aerodynamics and environmental turbulence** impact the **maneuverability and agility** of quad-rotor drones?  Conversely, how does that inform the drone design?
+ Basically, is it possible to perform a **full-stack optimization** of an engineering system, that bridges the "inner optimization" of its subsystems (e.g., aero-structural opt. of wings) and the "outer optimization" of the control and autonomy (e.g., trajectory opt. and controller design)?  This should **release the full potential** of an engineering system.

# Impossible Trinity of Modeling

The crux of integrated MDAOC is the modeling of complex multi-physics dynamics.  And this is a **"holy grail"** problem:  Is it possible to find **one** mathematical model that is
+ **Accurate to reproduce the dynamics**, that
  - Works over the entire range of operating conditions
  - Captures nonlinearities such as bifurcations and limit cycles
+ **Computationally efficient to evaluate**, that
  - Supports automatic differentiation for large-scale optimization
  - Suits for deployment on hardware and real-time computing
+ **Supports infinite-dimensional parameters**, e.g.,
  - Geometrical shapes and material properties, as distributed parameters, for optimization
  - Control inputs and system states, as time-varying parameters, for autonomy

Usually, it is impossible to have all three bullets at the same time, just like the [impossible trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity).

However, **this is what the APUS Lab aims to tackle.**

# Our Methodology

In APUS Lab, we use a **closed-loop and integrated set of methods** to tackle the Grand Challenge:

#### High-Fidelity Multi-Physics
We use simulation, with experimental validation, to resolve **unknown physics**.

+ [Computational Framework for Hypersonic Aerothermoelasticity](/rsch_hypate/)

#### Scientific Data Analysis
We extract out **physical knowledge** from the sheer volume of multi-physics simulation data.
