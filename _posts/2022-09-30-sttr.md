Together with [AnalySwift](https://analyswift.com/), one of the world-leading experts in structural analysis, and collaborators [Zhenbo Wang](https://volweb.utk.edu/~zwang124/) (UT Knoxville) and [Xin Liu](https://xinliugroup.uta.edu/) (UT Arlington), we are awarded an Army STTR Phase I project, "Rapid Aeroservoelastic Design of Morphing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", that aims to perform rapid yet accurate design space exploration for highly agile morphing aerial vehicles.  In this 6-month study, we focus on the demonstration of technological capabilities in aeroservoelastic analysis, flight analysis, modeling of smart materials, and composite structural analysis, as well as the integration of the four under an optimization framework.
