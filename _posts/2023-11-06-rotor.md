This year, we presented at the annual review meeting of VLRCOE ([Vertical Lift Research Center of Excellence](https://www.vlrcoe.psu.edu/)) and kicked-off a new additional task on the aeroelastic optimization of high-speed composite rotor blades, with an ultimate goal to consider multiple practical factors/disciplines during the optimization.  This project is led by Dr. Edward Smith.

This is just a start, and more details to come in 2024!
