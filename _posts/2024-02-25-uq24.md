The [SIAM UQ24](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/uq24) occurs in Trieste, Italy.  While we could not be physically present there, we contribute a talk on physics-infused reduced-order modeling as part of a [minisymposium](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=78427): "Recent Advances in Surrogate Modeling for UQ of Large-Scale Simulations".

The central idea is that, conventional surrogates for UQ of dynamical systems only support a limited number of parameters, while we aim to leverage the PIROM methodology to build surrogates that are of **infinite-dimensional** parameters by directly encoding known dynamics into the model.  We connect this idea to the well-known Mori-Zwanzig formalism, and present two algorithms for learning PIROMs from data, that build on our lab member Carlos' [previous work](/rsch_pirom/).
