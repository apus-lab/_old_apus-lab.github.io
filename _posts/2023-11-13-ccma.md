The symposium on computational mathematics for engineering and sciences, held by [CCMA](https://ccma.math.psu.edu/conferences-and-workshops/symposium/), took place on Nov. 13-14.  We contributed a poster on learning algorithms for dynamical systems, that achieve high accuracy with low computational cost and, most importantly, are easy to implement.  This is a combination of work from our Ph.D. students, Yin Yu and Carlos Vargas Venegas.
