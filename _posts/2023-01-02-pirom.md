We have been developing a novel **physics-infused reduced-order modeling (PIROM)** approach for efficient and accurate modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems. The PIROM consists of

a physics-based dynamical component that 
+ represents the known physical processes, and
+ ensures validity of the model over a wide range of operating conditions

and a data-driven dynamical component that
+ represents the unknown physical processes, and
+ corrects the dynamics for higher predictive fidelity

Both components are **differential equations**, and hence new algorithms based on **optimal control theory** are developed to train these models.

One benchmark problem that we considered is the high-speed aerothermal modeling of a heat-conducting and deforming structure.  The PIROM demonstrated superior performance than the conventional surrogate models, in terms of **accuracy, sampling efficiency, and generalizability** over a wide range of operating conditions and structural boundary conditions.

Furthermore, the PIROM-based aerothermal model is applied to the aerothermal load modeling for **hypersonic aerothermoelastic (ATE)** analysis and is found to accelerate the ATE simulations by two to three orders of magnitude while maintaining an accuracy comparable to high-fidelity solutions based on computational fluid dynamics.

Figure on the right illustrates the superior capability of PIROM in **coupled** ATE simulation in a scenario **unseen** to all models.
+ TVI - physics-based differential model: Simple but not accurate
+ POD/Kriging - conventional surrogate: Brutal force and limited range of applicability
+ PIROM - Accurate and generalizable.

Note that coupled analysis is the most challenging scenario for testing a ROM, as **modeling errors propagates and accumulates over time**.

The PIROM-based ATE solver is further demonstrated by a parametric study on the effects of boundary conditions and rib supports on the ATE response of a compliant and heat-conducting panel structure. The results not only reveal the **dramatic snap-through behavior** with respect to spring constraints of boundary conditions but also demonstrate the potential of the PIROM to facilitate the rapid and accurate **design and optimization of multidisciplinary systems such as hypersonic structures**.
